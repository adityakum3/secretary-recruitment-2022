# Programming Tasks

## Task 1 : Snake

Almost everyone must have played the game of snake in old devices. A snake game is a simple game where a snake moves around a box trying to eat an apple. Once it successfully eats the apple, the length of the snake increases by one. Then the game is over when the snake runs into itself or any of the four walls of the box.

Find the `snake.py` file. It has some boiler plate code to simulate the game of snake. For the sake of simplicity and focusing only on the coding aspect and not the graphics, the game we have implemented is terminal based. You are to complete missing pieces of the code to make the game run properly. The code has helpful comments to guide you through the process.

Pay special attention to comments. Comments starting with `#` are explanations or reasonings to why things are written a specific way. Comments starting with `###` are instruction for you to follow.

Note that you are **not allowed to modify already written pieces of code**.
**_Submit_** the completed `snake.py` file.

Brownie points for adding the following features :

- The movement speed of snake increases progressively as it eats more apples.
- Maintain a score of the player, to be displayed each frame, depending on the number of apples eaten and how optimally has the player reached apple (how you define optimality is upto you, just do not forget to explain it int the comments to your code).
- Or any additinal feature you want to add.

Still new to python? [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw) should get you covered.

## Task 2: Conway's Game of Life

Another really simple game/simulation which can be done in terminal itself is Conwayâ€™s Game of Life. The rules to the game are pretty simple.

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Find the `conways.py` file. You are to complete missing pieces of the code to make the game run properly.

Pay special attention to comments. Comments starting with `#` are explanations or reasonings to why things are written a specific way. Comments starting with `###` are instruction for you to follow.

Note that you are **not allowed to modify already written pieces of code**.
**_Submit_** the completed `conways.py` file.

Brownie points if you add a few gliders and other self-propagating/generating structures to it instead of randomly spawning. Or any additional feature you want to add. Google Conwayâ€™s Game of Life and youâ€™ll find pretty interesting and elaborate structures people have found. Its almost like simulating life itself.

Hope you find the tasks interesting.
